        <h2>3 Objectives, purposes and description of processing</h2>
        <p>
          Our online platform pursues a transparent and responsible data processing policy that ensures the protection
          of privacy and compliance with applicable data protection regulations. The objectives, purposes and
          description of the processing of user data are set out in detail below:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Objectives of data processing:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating an account to use the platform:</strong> The account is required to log into the platform
            and access the various functions and services. Registration is voluntary and allows users to manage their
            projects or ideas and interact with other users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Forgotten password:</strong> Users have the option of resetting their password if they have
            forgotten it. They can request a password recovery email via a corresponding function.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Creating projects or ideas:</strong> Users can upload and publish their projects or ideas on the
            platform, whether they are projects from their private environment or ideas that they have developed during
            their studies. This function allows users to showcase their creativity and receive feedback from the
            community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Viewing ideas or projects and creating comments:</strong> The platform offers users the opportunity
            to view other users' projects or ideas and leave comments. This promotes interactive exchange and enables
            users to support and inspire each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Uploading various materials for projects or ideas:</strong> Users can upload various materials to
            their projects or ideas, such as Word or PDF documents. This allows them to provide additional information
            and present their projects or ideas more comprehensively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication between users via comment functions:</strong> The platform offers comment functions
            through which users can communicate with each other. This allows users to give feedback, ask questions and
            share their projects or ideas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recommendation system for interesting ideas, projects or people:</strong> A recommendation system is
            used to suggest interesting ideas, projects or people to users. These recommendations are based on the
            user's history and the tags entered during the registration process. As a result, users receive personalised
            suggestions that correspond to their interests and preferences.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Description of the data processing:</strong><br>
          Data processing includes the collection, storage, processing and use of personal data in accordance with the
          statutory provisions on data protection. The processed data includes the following user information such as
          name, email address, profile picture and information on projects created or comments submitted (see point 4
          Data categories).<br>
          The data collected is used exclusively for the above-mentioned purposes and is only stored for as long as is
          necessary to fulfil these purposes. Appropriate security measures are taken to ensure the confidentiality,
          integrity and availability of the data and to prevent unauthorised access, use or disclosure.

        <h2>5 Sources of data collection</h2>
        <p>
          We process the data that you provide to us in connection with the use of and registration on the IdeaLize
          platform.
        </p>

        <h2>6 Legal basis for data processing</h2>
        <p>
          The legal basis for the provision of the online platform is the public interest or the mission of Heilbronn
          University in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e GDPR in conjunction with Sections 2, 12 LHG. The
          processing is also carried out in the context of providing the platform to the data subjects for their
          purposes and thus on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
        </p>

        <h2>7 Further data protection information</h2>
        <h3>7.1 Existence of automated decision-making (profiling)</h3>
        <p>
          We do not use any purely automated decision-making processes in accordance with Art. 22 GDPR.<br>
          If we wish to use such a procedure in individual cases in the future, we will inform you of this separately.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Comment:</em> A recommendation system uses the interests entered in the registration process to provide
          suggestions for suitable projects/ideas or people. (The following will be integrated in the future: Via viewed
          or bookmarked projects, suggestions for similar projects, ideas or people will also be made available to the
          user on the basis of this data).
        </p>
        <h3>7.2 Scope of the obligations to provide us with data</h3>
        <p>
          Use of the IdeaLize platform is voluntary. There is no obligation to use the platform.
        </p>
        <h3>7.3 Storage and deletion periods</h3>
        <p>
          In principle, we process the data in the aforementioned procedures for as long as is necessary to fulfil our
          tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Standard deletion periods after inactivity:</strong><br>
          After registration, personal data such as user profile information is automatically deleted if the user does
          not perform any actions in their account (e.g. login) within 1 year.<br>
          The user receives a notification before the automatic deletion and has the option of extending the deletion
          period through a simple activity (e.g. login).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Deletion at the express request of the user:</strong><br>
          Users can have their account and all associated personal data deleted at any time. Deleted data will be
          irrevocably removed from our systems within 4 weeks.<br>
          In addition to deleting their account, users also have the option of deleting all content they have created,
          such as projects, ideas or contributions. This option allows the user to retain control over their personal
          data and content and ensure that none of the content they have created remains on the platform after their
          account has been deleted.<br>
          Deleted content will be irrevocably removed from our systems within a specified period of time to ensure the
          user's privacy and data protection rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Comment on copyright confirmation and disclaimer:</em><br>
          When registering on the IdeaLize platform and uploading files, the user has confirmed that he/she owns the
          copyright to the uploaded content or has the necessary rights to use it on the platform. The owner of the
          platform accepts no liability for copyright infringements by users. It is the responsibility of users to
          ensure that they have the necessary rights to the content they upload.
        </p>
