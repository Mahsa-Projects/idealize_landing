        <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
        <br /><br />

        <h1>General Terms and Conditions for "HS Heilbronn Apps"</h1>
        <p>(The following General Terms and Conditions ("T&C") also include statutory information regarding consumer
          rights pursuant to the provisions on distance selling contracts and electronic commerce.)</p>

        <h2>A General Provisions</h2>

        <h3>1 Scope</h3>

        <h4>1.1</h4>
        <p>These T&C shall apply between Hochschule Heilbronn, Address, Germany ("Provider"), and users who utilize the
          Provider’s free applications (the "HS Heilbronn Apps") ("Users"). The Provider's website can be accessed at
          the web address [please add URL]. These T&C shall apply in the version valid at the time the respective
          contract is concluded.</p>

        <h4>1.2</h4>
        <p>The Provider's services shall be available to both entrepreneurs (§ 14 Section 1 of the German Civil Code,
          “BGB”) and consumers (§ 13 BGB) domiciled in Germany. Specific provisions within these T&C for entrepreneurs
          or consumers shall be marked accordingly.</p>

        <h4>1.3</h4>
        <p>Users of the HS Heilbronn Apps shall primarily be students and employees of Hochschule Heilbronn but may also
          include external persons who wish to use the features of the HS Heilbronn Apps.</p>

        <h4>1.4</h4>
        <p>The User agrees to these T&C when registering for the HS Heilbronn Apps.</p>

        <h4>1.5</h4>
        <p>The Provider reserves the right to amend these T&C at any time without stating reasons. The User shall be
          notified of such changes via electronic notification sent to the email address provided during registration.
          If the User does not object to the changes within four weeks of receiving the notification, the amended
          provisions shall be deemed accepted. In the event of an objection by the User, the Provider shall be entitled
          to terminate the usage contract with a notice period of one (1) week.</p>
        <p>Any right to amendment of these T&C under this clause shall exclude provisions affecting the primary
          obligations of the contracting parties that would significantly alter the balance between principal and
          counterperformance obligations, as well as other fundamental changes to the contractual duties that are
          equivalent to the conclusion of a new contract. Such changes shall require an express contractual agreement.
        </p>

        <h3>2 Subject Matter and Scope of Services</h3>

        <h4>2.1</h4>
        <p>The subject matter shall be the use of the HS Heilbronn Apps. The Provider shall make various apps available
          with the HS Heilbronn Apps, primarily intended for students and staff members but also accessible to external
          parties unless otherwise specified during the order process. The exact content of the HS Heilbronn Apps can be
          found in the service description available online during the order/registration process.</p>

        <h4>2.2</h4>
        <p>The HS Heilbronn Apps uses AI functionalities. Information regarding these can be found in the product
          description within the respective store (Android and iOS) or on the website (web version of the HS Heilbronn
          Apps). No centralized user data storage shall occur. Further information can be found in the <a
            href="[Privacy Policy]">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h4>2.3</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall be entitled to make changes to the content or functionalities of the HS Heilbronn Apps at
          any time, provided these changes are reasonable for the User, taking into account their interests. The
          Provider shall also be entitled to have parts or the entirety of the services provided by third parties.</p>

        <h4>2.4</h4>
        <p>It shall be the User's responsibility to ensure and maintain the conditions necessary to use the HS Heilbronn
          Apps (e.g., up-to-date browser, internet access with sufficient bandwidth). Information in this regard can be
          found in the product description within the respective store (Android and iOS) or on the website (web version
          of the HS Heilbronn Apps).</p>

        <h4>2.5</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall only owe the performance of the service itself, not any specific result the User may have
          intended, unless the Provider has contractually guaranteed a specific result.</p>

        <h3>3 Conclusion of Contract</h3>

        <h4>3.1</h4>
        <p>The usage contract between the Provider and the User for the HS Heilbronn Apps shall be concluded through the
          User's registration in the App (by providing name/username, email address, and a self-chosen password),
          receipt of a registration confirmation (via email), and completion of registration by the User (by clicking on
          a confirmation link). The Provider shall confirm the conclusion of the usage contract to the User
          electronically without undue delay.</p>

        <h4>3.2</h4>
        <p>The Provider reserves the right to revoke the User's registration for the HS Heilbronn Apps due to provision
          of false information during registration, violation of their contractual obligations (see Clause 4), or misuse
          of the HS Heilbronn Apps, at any time and without notice, and to block the User’s access.</p>

          promptly report this to the Provider by contacting [please insert email address]. The Provider shall reserve
          the right to block and/or delete such User Content at short notice.</p>

        <h4>4.8</h4>
        <p>The User shall assure and acknowledge as a duty of cooperation that they will adhere to the following Code of

        <h3>5 User Content and Usage Rights</h3>

        <h4>5.1</h4>
        <p>The User shall grant the Provider a simple, non-transferable, spatially and temporally unrestricted right to
          use the User Content. However, the Provider shall only use the User Content to the extent necessary for
          operating the HS Heilbronn Apps. The Provider shall not reproduce, make publicly available, distribute, or
          publish User Content outside the HS Heilbronn Apps. However, the Provider cannot exclude the possibility of
          User Content being used by third parties outside the HS Heilbronn Apps. The Provider shall have no influence
          over such usage and shall not be responsible for it.</p>

        <h4>5.2</h4>
        <p>The User shall create content within the HS Heilbronn Apps. Any material the User posts or otherwise provides
          through the HS Heilbronn Apps shall hereinafter be referred to as "User Content". Subject to the usage rights
          granted below, the User shall retain all rights to their content posted within the HS Heilbronn Apps and shall
          be solely responsible for it.</p>

        <h4>5.3</h4>
        <p>The User shall be obligated to comply with all applicable laws when publishing User Content and to avoid
          violating third-party rights. This shall specifically apply to personal rights and intellectual property
          rights (e.g., copyrights and trademark rights). The User shall ensure they are authorized to use images,
          videos, and texts before publishing. Should the User breach this obligation, they shall be obligated to
          indemnify the Provider against all claims asserted by third parties due to the violation unless the User acted
          without fault.</p>

        <h4>5.4</h4>
        <p>These usage rights shall be granted by the User to the Provider for an indefinite period. The User may delete
          User Content at any time if they choose to do so.</p>

        <h4>5.5</h4>
        <p>In the event of a third-party claim, the User shall be obligated to promptly and truthfully provide the
          Provider with all necessary information to assess and defend against the claims.</p>

        <h4>5.6</h4>
        <p>Any further liability of the User under these provisions shall remain unaffected.</p>

        <h3>6 Rights in Case of Breach of Contractual Obligations</h3>

        <h4>6.1</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall reserve the right to revoke the User's registration at any time without notice and to
          block the User’s access in the event of false information provided during registration, breach of contractual
          obligations, or misuse of the HS Heilbronn Apps.</p>

        <h4>6.2</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall be entitled to delete, in whole or in part, any posts, comments, or other User Content
          posted by the User, or to delay or deny the publication of other User Content if there are concrete
          indications that the content violates these T&C or legal provisions, or if the User has otherwise culpably
          breached their obligations under these T&C. In such cases, the Provider may also warn the User and/or
          temporarily or permanently exclude them from using the HS Heilbronn Apps.</p>

        <h4>6.3</h4>
        <p>If the Provider has excluded the User from using the HS Heilbronn Apps or terminated the usage contract, the
          User shall not be allowed to use the HS Heilbronn Apps with other User accounts, including accounts created
          for third parties, nor may they re-register for the use of the HS Heilbronn Apps.</p>

        <h4>6.4</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall be entitled to restrict or terminate the provision of the HS Heilbronn Apps in whole or in
          part, or to delay the publication of personal profiles or other User Content if necessary due to capacity
          limitations, server security or integrity, technical measures, or to ensure the proper or improved provision
          of services (maintenance work).</p>

        <h4>6.5</h4>
        <p>Apple and its subsidiaries shall be third-party beneficiaries of these T&C. Upon the User’s acceptance of
          these T&C, Apple shall have the right to enforce any rights or claims under this contract against the User.
        </p>

        <h3>7 Usage Rights</h3>

        <h4>7.1</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall grant the User, during the term of the usage contract pursuant to Clause 3.1, a
          non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable right to use the HS Heilbronn Apps and the associated
          functionalities remotely on the Provider's systems as intended, subject to these T&C.</p>

        <h4>7.2</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall provide the HS Heilbronn Apps under the Apache License, Version 2.0, free of charge. The
          Provider agrees that the HS Heilbronn Apps shall be subject to the terms of the relevant open-source
          license(s) and waives any claims that may arise from the publication and use of the software under these
          licenses.</p>

        <h4>7.3</h4>
        <p>The User shall also be granted the right to publish and distribute the HS Heilbronn Apps under one or more
          open-source licenses at their discretion, provided they comply with the terms of the Apache License, Version
          2.0. In particular, the User shall retain copyright notices and licensing information.</p>

        <h4>7.4</h4>
        <p>All intellectual property rights shall remain with the Provider or the respective rights holders. The User
          shall not receive any additional rights, particularly concerning the App, the underlying software application,
          or the operating software.</p>

        <h3>8 Additional Terms for iOS App Use</h3>

        <h4>8.1</h4>
        <p>These additional terms are minimum requirements for self-created app terms stipulated by Apple. They shall
          apply if the User obtained the App from the Apple App Store.</p>

        <h4>8.2</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall be solely responsible for the App. The Store Operator shall not participate in the
          development nor influence the content or design of the App. Therefore the following applies:</p>

        <h5>8.2.1</h5>
        <p>
          Support and maintenance of the App shall be the sole responsibility of the Provider, not the Store Operator.
          The Provider’s contact information is as follows:<br>
          Hochschule Heilbronn<br>
          Bildungscampus<br>
          Max-Planck-Straße 39<br>
          74081 Heilbronn<br>
          Tel.: [please insert]<br>
          EMail: [please insert]
        </p>

        <h5>8.2.2</h5>
        <p>The Provider warrants the defect-free condition of the HS Heilbronn Apps. If the App or a service relating to
          it is defective, the User may also contact the Store Operator, who may, if applicable, refund the purchase
          price. Beyond this, the Store Operator shall not be responsible for the App's warranty. Any further liability
          shall rest solely with the Provider.</p>

        <h5>8.2.3</h5>
        <p>The Provider alone shall be responsible for any claims by the User or third parties arising from the App or
          its use, including claims concerning product liability, violations of statutory duties, regulatory
          requirements, or consumer protection laws.</p>

        <h5>8.2.4</h5>
        <p>In the event of third-party claims regarding the infringement of intellectual property rights by the App
          itself or the possession and use of the App by the User, the Provider alone shall be responsible for
          addressing and resolving such claims and defending against them, not the Store Operator.</p>

        <h4>8.3</h4>
        <p>In addition to Clause 7, the Provider shall grant the User the right to access and use the App through other
          accounts associated with the User via "Family Sharing" or bulk purchases.</p>

        <h4>8.4</h4>
        <p>The User shall assure that they:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>8.4.1 are not domiciled in a country against which the United States government has imposed an embargo or
            that has been designated by the United States government as supporting terrorism, and</li>
          <li>8.4.2 are not themselves on a list of persons with whom the United States government has prohibited or
            restricted trade (restricted party list).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9 Statutory Defect Rights</h3>
        <p>The statutory warranty rights shall apply to the Provider's services.</p>

        <h3>10 Liability</h3>

        <h4>10.1</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall be liable to the User for all damages caused by the Provider, its legal representatives,
          or vicarious agents in cases of intentional misconduct or gross negligence, without limitation.</p>

        <h4>10.2</h4>
        <p>In cases of slight negligence, the Provider shall be liable without limitation for damages resulting from
          injury to life, body, or health. Otherwise, the Provider shall only be liable if it has breached a material
          contractual obligation (Cardinal Duty, ”Kardinalpflicht”). Cardinal Duties are obligations whose fulfillment
          is essential to the proper performance of the usage contract, whose breach endangers the achievement of the
          contract's purpose, and on whose compliance the contractual partner may regularly rely. In such cases,
          liability shall be limited to the compensation of foreseeable damages typical for the contract.</p>

        <h4>10.3</h4>
        <p>Furthermore, if and to the extent that the Provider provides its services to the User free of charge, the
          Provider's liability for all cases of slight negligence shall be excluded.</p>

        <h3>11 Confidentiality and Data Protection</h3>

        <h4>11.1</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall treat any information that becomes known to it during the performance of its contractual
          services confidentially and shall not disclose or otherwise use it.</p>

        <h4>11.2</h4>
        <p>The Provider shall comply with the data protection laws applicable to it. The Provider's Privacy Policy shall
          be available at all times at the following web address: [URL to be added.].</p>

        <h3>12 Term and Termination</h3>

        <h4>12.1</h4>
        <p>The usage contract for the HS Heilbronn Apps, as a framework agreement between the Provider and the User,
          shall be concluded for an indefinite period. Both parties may terminate the usage contract with one day’s
          notice, effective at the end of the following day. The right to extraordinary termination for good cause shall
          remain unaffected. The User shall terminate the usage contract via the corresponding button in the HS
          Heilbronn Apps. The Provider shall terminate the usage contract in text form.</p>

        <h4>12.2</h4>
        <p>Upon termination of the usage contract, the User shall be prompted to specify whether they wish to delete
          User Content, retain User Content anonymously, or retain User Content in the App with the User's real name. If
          the User does not provide such a statement, User Content not deleted by the User shall remain in the App
          following termination in accordance with Clause 5.4. If Provider terminates the usage contract, User Content
          shall be deleted.</p>

        <h4>12.3</h4>
        <p>The data provided by the User and the created User profile or User account shall be deleted by the Provider
          upon termination of the usage contract, subject to any retention obligations. If the Provider is permitted to
          retain data due to statutory or other reasons, the data may alternatively be locked. Once the retention
          obligation or authorization expires, the Provider shall delete the data.</p>

        <h3>13 Final Provisions</h3>

        <h4>13.1</h4>
        <p>German law shall apply to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
          Goods. If the User is a consumer, the applicability of mandatory provisions of the legal system applicable at
          his place of residence shall remain unaffected.</p>

        <h4>13.2</h4>
        <p>The place of performance for all mutual obligations arising from the usage contract shall be the Provider's
          registered office.</p>

        <h4>13.3</h4>
        <p>If the User is an Entrepreneur, the place of jurisdiction shall be the Provider's registered office.</p>

        <h4>13.4</h4>
        <p>The HS Heilbronn Apps and Content, including but not limited to texts, photos, images, graphics,
          illustrations, and software, as well as all trademarks, patents, and utility models, shall be protected
          against unauthorized use by industrial property rights, in particular copyrights,
          name and image rights, trademarks, and patents or utility models in force. Usage shall require prior written
          consent from the Provider or, if the respective rights do not lie with the Provider, from the rights holder.
